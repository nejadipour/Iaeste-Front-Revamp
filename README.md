# IAESTE Iran Frontend Revamp

This repository contains the code for the redevelopment of the IAESTE Iran website. The project was built using React and Vite, with the goal of providing a modern, user-friendly interface for the organization's online platform.

## Project Status

As of now, development on this project has ceased. Due to unforeseen circumstances and differing perspectives with the IAESTE Iran team, further work on this codebase has been discontinued. The repository is now public and will not receive any future updates from the original developer.

## Usage

Despite the halt in development, the code has been used for the IAESTE Iran's website and can be accessed at [www.iaeste.ir](http://www.iaeste.ir).
